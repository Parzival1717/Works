   more easier to me to understand how it works-->
   <!-- I did one person and copypaste to others with parameters which I like -->
   <!-- Actor image I did with border and shadow, it was easy to do without google,
    cause its logically undestandable -->
    <!-- I wanted to do picture closer to center, but align="center" doesnt work at all -->
    <!-- I made around shadow for the text to make it easier to read
  It was realy hard to do it with out help, so I found on the website again

      The return of Chris pine as Steve Trevor, who died in the first part,
      was one of the main discussions of the film and causes a huge stir in this regard.<br>
      At the moment, it is not known exactly how Steve will come to life, but it is known
      that this will contribute to Maxwell Lord. Also, Steve and Diana will switch places<br>
      compared to the last film, where Steve showed Diana a new world, but now in the trailers
      you can see that this is what Diana teaches Steve.</b><br>
